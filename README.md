# ArrayLists

Custom implementations of different ArrayLists, inspired by Heinz Kabutz.

I have no real goal with this repository just having some fun, especially comparing some performance between the different implenetations.

See the PerformanceComparison class for basic comparison between the different implementations.

## My Expectation

PlainArrayList should perform similar to the java.util.ArrayList version, I do not expect big differences.
However, according to Heinz, the circular implementation should result in a boost of a 1k magnitude. Let's see :)
